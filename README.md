# Introduction

When working with Terraform, it is essential to manage the state of your infrastructure in a secure and reliable way. One common way to do this is by storing the Terraform state in an S3 bucket. However, there is a provisioning paradox when it comes to creating an S3 bucket for Terraform state: you need to provision the bucket before you can store the state, but the provisioning process requires resources that do not yet exist.

# Problem

The problem is that when creating an S3 bucket for Terraform state, you need to provision the bucket before you can store the state, but the provisioning process requires resources that do not yet exist. This creates a provisioning paradox where you need to provision the resources before you can create the storage resource for the state.

# Solution

To solve the provisioning paradox of storing Terraform state in an S3 bucket, we recommend using the "bootstrap" approach. In this approach, you create a small Terraform configuration that creates the S3 bucket for storing state and then run this configuration manually outside of Terraform. Once the bucket is created, you can use it to store the state for all other Terraform configurations.

We have provided an example of how to use the bootstrap approach to create an S3 bucket for Terraform state. The solution involves creating a new Terraform configuration file named `bootstrap.tf` and a shell script named `bootstrap.sh`. The `bootstrap.tf` file contains the Terraform configuration for creating the S3 bucket, while the `bootstrap.sh` file contains the shell commands to initialize and apply the Terraform configuration.

## Running the bootstrap configuration

To run the bootstrap configuration, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory and navigate into it.
2. Create a new file named `bootstrap.tf` in the directory and copy the contents of the `bootstrap.tf` file provided in this repository into the new file.
3. Create a new file named `bootstrap.sh` in the directory and copy the contents of the `bootstrap.sh` file provided in this repository into the new file.
4. Run the following command to make the `bootstrap.sh` file executable:

      ```
        chmod +x bootstrap.sh
      
      ```

5. Run the following command to initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

      ```
         ./bootstrap.sh
      ```

6. After the S3 bucket has been created, you can modify your other Terraform configurations to use the new S3 bucket as the backend.

## Updating the backend configuration

To update the backend configuration in your other Terraform configurations to use the new S3 bucket, follow these steps:

1. Open each Terraform configuration file that you want to update.
2. Locate the `backend` block in the configuration file.
3. Replace the existing `bucket` value with the name of the S3 bucket that you created in the bootstrap configuration.
4. Save the configuration file.

# Conclusion

By using the bootstrap approach to create an S3 bucket for Terraform state, you can solve the provisioning paradox and manage your infrastructure in a secure and reliable way. We hope that this example and the `bootstrap.sh` file provided in this repository will help you get started with using an S3 bucket for Terraform state in your own infrastructure.
